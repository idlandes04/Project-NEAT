# Project NEAT Progress Summary - March 15, 2025

## Phase 3.1.1: Synthetic Data Generator Integration (COMPLETED)

We have successfully completed Phase 3.1.1 of Project NEAT, which focused on the Synthetic Data Generator Integration. Key accomplishments include:

1. **Fixed Code Issues:**
   - Added support for the 'labels' parameter in the model's forward method
   - Fixed BLT input handling to ensure bytes are within the 0-255 range
   - Fixed configuration issues for proper component integration
   - Ensured all tests pass successfully

2. **Created Mock Models:**
   - Mock BLT entropy estimator for byte-level processing
   - Mock MVoT visual codebook for multimodal visualization

3. **Generated Synthetic Data:**
   - Implemented all required problem types (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, sequence)
   - Added advanced problem types (multi-step, algebraic, non-linear sequences)
   - Created component-specific problems for each NEAT component (Titans, Transformer², MVoT, BLT)

4. **Prepared for Full-Scale Training:**
   - Fixed all test failures
   - Created detailed training instructions
   - Prepared scripts for training on Windows PC with 3080ti GPU
   - Successfully ran test training on Mac as proof of concept

5. **Integration Testing:**
   - Integrated data generator with main training pipeline
   - Implemented metrics for measuring generalization performance
   - Created visualization tools for comparing model variations

## Next Phase: 3.1.2 Baseline Transformer Implementation

With Phase 3.1.1 complete, we are now ready to proceed to Phase 3.1.2, which focuses on implementing baseline transformer models for comparative evaluation. Key tasks include:

1. Create parameter-matched vanilla transformer for fair comparison
2. Implement shared evaluation harness for consistent benchmarking
3. Design metrics for measuring component-specific benefits
4. Create visualization tools for performance comparison
5. Perform full 100M parameter model training on Windows PC with 3080ti GPU

## Training Plan

1. Transfer entire project to Windows PC
2. Download the MMR1-Math-RL-Data dataset
3. Generate comprehensive synthetic math data
4. Train the full 100M parameter model with all components
5. Evaluate on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution problems
6. Measure component-specific benefits through ablation testing

## Component Distribution (100M Parameters)

- Core transformer: ~40M parameters
- Titans memory system: ~20M parameters
- Transformer² adaptation: ~20M parameters
- BLT processor: ~10M parameters
- MVoT processor: ~10M parameters
