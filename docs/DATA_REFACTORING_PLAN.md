# Project NEAT Data Pipeline Refactoring Plan

## 1. Current Issues Analysis

### 1.1 Directory Structure Issues
- Data files being saved to temporary directories that don't exist: `./data/blt_training_data/temp/train/`
- Path mismatches between where files are saved and where they're expected to be found
- Inconsistent directory structure across different data types
- No clear separation between raw, processed, and cached data
- Missing parent directories when attempting to write files

### 1.2 Data Pipeline Issues
- Failed to process any text chunks (0 chunks from 46 files)
- Failed to process any binary data (0 chunks from binary sources)
- Only synthetic data (2000 samples) was successfully generated
- Model was trained on severely limited data which explains the uniform entropy values (7.9995)
- Duplicate code across files for similar data loading functionality
- Inconsistent error handling approach in data loading code
- Mixing of data generation and data loading responsibilities

### 1.3 Error Patterns
- Almost all errors are file not found errors pointing to nonexistent directories
- Despite errors, the training proceeded with only synthetic data
- No graceful fallback when data directories are missing
- Missing proper error propagation and reporting

### 1.4 Model Performance Issues
- Uniform entropy values (all ~7.9995) and 100% boundary ratio in evaluation
- This is a sign that the model learned very little from the limited synthetic data
- No data validation to ensure quality of training data
- Missing comprehensive data statistics to diagnose issues

## 2. Standardized Directory Structure

## Phase 0-1 overview:

We've completed Phase 0 (Preparation) and Phase 1 (Core Infrastructure) of the
  DATA_REFACTORING_PLAN.md:

  1. Created standardized directory structure for data:
    - /data/raw/ for unprocessed data
    - /data/processed/ for training-ready data
    - /data/cache/ for intermediate cached data
    - /data/metadata/ for statistics and tracking
  2. Implemented core infrastructure classes:
    - PathManager: Robust path handling with normalization, validation and directory creation
    - DataManager: Base class for data processing with configuration validation and error
  handling
    - CacheManager: Versioned cache system with automatic invalidation and integrity checks
  3. Added comprehensive unit tests that verify all functionality

  The refactoring will consolidate data handling from entropy_estimator_trainer.py into the new
  infrastructure. Next steps would be implementing specialized processors for text, binary, and
  synthetic data (Phase 2) and integrating with the training system (Phase 3).

## Phase 1-3 Overview
Great! All our tests are now passing. Let's summarize what we've accomplished:

  1. Updated the test files to import ByteDataset and EntropyEstimatorTrainer from the correct
  location (src.trainers.main_trainer instead of src.components.blt.entropy_estimator_trainer).
  2. Fixed the initialization of CacheManager in the ByteDataset class to match the current API.
  3. Fixed the TextDataProcessor and BinaryDataProcessor initialization to match their current
  APIs.
  4. Modified the ByteDataset.load_data method to directly read files instead of using processor
  methods that no longer exist.
  5. Updated the ByteDataset.getitem method to return data in the format the tests expect.
  6. Fixed the EntropyEstimatorTrainer to accept train_dataset and eval_dataset parameters.
  7. Modified EntropyEstimatorTrainer.save_model to avoid pickling issues with the dynamically
  created Config class.

  All the CLI end-to-end tests, ByteDatasetAndTrainer tests, and related components are now
  working properly.

## Phase 3.3 Completion - CLI Interface Integration

  2. Added support for data validation and directory structure verification
  3. Implemented cache management and cleaning functionality
  4. Added dataset metadata viewing and quality assessment 
  5. Created detailed configuration editing for all data processing components
  6. Integrated with the new data pipeline components
  7. Removed dependency on the deprecated run_cli.py script
  8. Added comprehensive data preparation commands:
     - Synthetic math data generation

  9. Added component-specific configuration settings for:
     - Text processing parameters
     - Binary processing parameters
     - Synthetic data parameters
     - Data mixing ratios and strategies
  
  The CLI interface now provides a professional, user-friendly experience with proper error handling,
  progress reporting, and comprehensive data management capabilities aligned with the standardized
  directory structure. All tests are passing, and the system is ready for Phase 4 enhancements.
