# BLT Entropy Estimator Fixes

This document summarizes the fixes made to the BLT (Byte-Level Transformer) entropy estimator training pipeline.

## Issues Fixed

1. **Mixed Precision Implementation**
   - Fixed `enable_mixed_precision()` function usage in `EntropyEstimatorTrainer.__init__`
   - Replaced deprecated `torch.cuda.amp.GradScaler()` with `torch.amp.GradScaler('cuda')`
   - Replaced deprecated `torch.cuda.amp.autocast()` with `torch.amp.autocast('cuda')`

2. **ByteDataset Size Consistency**
   - Fixed inconsistent tensor sizes in `ByteDataset.__getitem__` method
   - Added additional checks to ensure all samples have exactly the specified block size
   - Added handling for both cached and newly generated samples
   - Implemented proper truncation/padding for any inconsistently sized data

3. **Training Metrics Calculation**
   - Fixed division by zero errors in the logging code
   - Added checks to prevent division by zero when calculating metrics like ms/step and samples/second
   - Improved error handling in the training loop

4. **CLI Argument Handling**
   - Fixed default value for `--mixed_precision` flag in `train_blt_entropy.py`
   - Removed `default=True` to ensure proper command-line flag behavior
   - Ensured config parsing is compatible with both direct and CLI-based training

5. **End-to-End Testing**
   - Created/updated end-to-end test in `tests/test_blt_end_to_end.py`
   - Verified training pipeline works correctly with minimal configuration
   - Added tests for ByteDataset, model creation, and minimal training

## Configuration Files

Two main configuration files were created/updated:

1. **Testing Configuration**: `scripts/main_cli_configs/blt_entropy_test.json`
   - Small model (64 hidden size, 2 layers, 4 heads)
   - Minimal training (5 steps)
   - Small batch size (4)
   - Used for quick testing

2. **Full Training Configuration**: `scripts/main_cli_configs/blt_entropy_final.json`
   - Larger model (384 hidden size, 6 layers, 12 heads)
   - Full training (20,000 steps)
   - Larger batch size (32) with gradient accumulation (4)
   - Used for final training

## Running Training

### Quick Test

```bash
python3 scripts/run_cli.py blt --config blt_entropy_test --auto-confirm --auto-continue
```

### Full Training

```bash
python3 scripts/run_cli.py blt --config blt_entropy_final --auto-confirm --auto-continue
```

## Key Components

- **ByteDataset**: Processes binary data into byte sequences for training
- **EntropyEstimatorTrainer**: Manages the training process for the BLT model
- **SmallByteLM**: The actual byte-level transformer model
- **CLI Interface**: Provides user-friendly command-line interface for training

All issues have been fixed and the pipeline now works correctly from end to end.
