# Phase 2.2.1 Plan: Coordinated Gradient Computation System

## Overview
This phase focuses on creating a shared infrastructure for gradient computation across components, particularly between Titans Memory System and Transformer² Adaptation. This is a critical foundation for test-time learning synchronization, enabling coordinated learning while maintaining component independence.

## Design Goals
1. **Unified Gradient Interface**: Create a common interface for gradient computation that all components can use
2. **Memory Efficiency**: Optimize memory usage during gradient computation through selective checkpointing 
3. **Component Independence**: Allow components to maintain their optimization strategies while sharing gradient information
4. **Platform Agnosticism**: Ensure the system works on both CUDA and Apple Silicon (Metal) backends
5. **Performance Optimization**: Minimize overhead of cross-component gradient computation

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Create Gradient Coordination Module
- Implement `GradientCoordinator` class in `src/components/learning/gradient_coordination.py`
- Create interfaces for:
  - Registering components for gradient tracking
  - Specifying component-specific gradient requirements
  - Managing gradient accumulation and sharing
  - Providing memory-efficient gradient computation

### 2. Implement Shared Gradient Infrastructure
- Create `SharedGradientContext` that tracks:
  - Active components requiring gradients
  - Computation graphs spanning multiple components
  - Gradient checkpointing boundaries
  - Component-specific optimization settings

### 3. Develop Memory-Efficient Gradient Computation
- Implement adaptive checkpointing based on component importance
- Create selective gradient computation for specific parameter subsets
- Optimize memory usage through gradient pruning for less important parameters
- Implement platform-specific optimizations (CUDA/Metal)

### 4. Integrate with Existing Components
- Modify Titans Memory System to use the shared gradient infrastructure
- Update Transformer² Adaptation to participate in coordinated gradient flow
- Add hooks in MVoT and BLT for potential gradient sharing

### 5. Implement Testing Framework
- Create unit tests for the gradient coordination module
- Develop integration tests across components
- Implement profiling tools to measure memory usage and computation time
- Create memory pressure tests to verify efficiency

## Success Criteria
1. Memory usage during gradient computation reduced by at least 30% compared to naïve approach
2. Gradient computation works reliably across components without altering individual component behavior
3. All tests pass on both CUDA and Metal backends
4. Different learning rates and optimization strategies can be applied to individual components
5. The system can isolate gradient flow to specific components when needed

## Timeline
1. Gradient Coordination Module: 2 days
2. Shared Gradient Infrastructure: 3 days
3. Memory-Efficient Computation: 2 days
4. Component Integration: 2 days
5. Testing and Optimization: 1 day

## Technical Considerations
- We'll need to carefully handle autograd requirements for each component
- Metal backend has limitations for some autograd operations that we'll need to work around
- Components may have different backward pass requirements that need reconciliation
- Gradient checkpointing boundaries need to be carefully placed to balance memory usage and computation time
