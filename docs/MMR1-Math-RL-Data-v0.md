You can treat it like any other public Hugging Face dataset and load it using the `datasets` library locally in Python. Here’s a quick rundown:

1. **Install the `datasets` library** (if you haven’t already):
   ```bash
   pip install datasets
   ```

2. **Load the dataset** (for example, the train split):
   ```python
   from datasets import load_dataset

   # Replace "train" with "test" or another split if needed
   dataset = load_dataset("MMR1/MMR1-Math-RL-Data-v0", split="train")
   ```

3. **Inspect the columns**  
   From the screenshot, it looks like the dataset has columns like:
   - `images` – contains a list of image files or references
   - `problem` – a string with the geometry/math problem
   - `answer` – the short string that represents the solution

   You can view them by checking:
   ```python
   print(dataset.column_names)
   print(dataset[0])
   ```
   This will show the keys (e.g. `"images", "problem", "answer"`) and an example row.

4. **Handling the images**  
   - Often, Hugging Face stores images as image files under the hood and `datasets` will provide them as a PIL image or as a path.  
   - You may need to transform or resize them in your training loop or using a `dataset.map(...)` operation.  

5. **Training locally**  
   - If you’re using a standard Hugging Face `Trainer`, you’d typically define a preprocessing function for both the text (`problem`) and the images.  
   - Something like:
     ```python
     def preprocess(example):
         # e.g. transform images, tokenize text, etc.
         return example

     dataset = dataset.map(preprocess, batched=True)
     ```

   - Then set up your model, tokenizer, and `TrainingArguments`, and feed `dataset` into your `Trainer` or into your custom training script.

6. **Dataset size**  
   - The UI shows around 7,233 rows in total, 5.78k in `train`.  
   - The raw parquet download is ~123 MB. Make sure you have enough disk space and bandwidth.

That’s the overall approach. In short: `pip install datasets`, load it with `load_dataset("MMR1/MMR1-Math-RL-Data-v0")`, inspect the fields, and integrate into your training pipeline.
