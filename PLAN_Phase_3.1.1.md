# Phase 3.1.1: Synthetic Data Generator Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for Phase 3.1.1 of Project NEAT: the Synthetic Data Generator Integration. This phase involves developing a comprehensive data generation and loading system to support the evaluation of the NEAT architecture, particularly focusing on demonstrating the benefits of test-time learning and component-based architecture.

## Completed Tasks

1. **Basic Data Generation**
   - [x] Implemented `MathDataGenerator` class for generating diverse mathematical problems
   - [x] Added support for progressive difficulty levels (BASIC, MEDIUM, ADVANCED, COMPLEX)
   - [x] Implemented multiple problem types (addition, subtraction, multiplication, sequence)
   - [x] Created a robust template system for varied problem representations
   - [x] Added train/test split functionality with controlled distribution shifts

2. **Data Loading Infrastructure**
   - [x] Implemented `MathDataTokenizer` for converting problems to token IDs
   - [x] Created `NEATMathDataset` for PyTorch compatibility
   - [x] Developed `NEATMathDataLoader` with batch preparation
   - [x] Added utilities for train/eval split creation

3. **Testing & Validation**
   - [x] Created comprehensive test suite for the data generator
   - [x] Implemented test cases for the data loader
   - [x] Added a demo script to visualize generated problems
   - [x] Validated operations across different difficulty levels

## Remaining Tasks (Current Phase 3.1.1)

1. **Advanced Problem Types**
   - [ ] Implement multi-step reasoning problems
   - [ ] Add algebraic equation problems for higher difficulty levels
   - [ ] Create sequence problems with non-linear patterns
   - [ ] Implement mixed-operation problems (e.g., nested arithmetic)

2. **Data Generation for Component Evaluation**
   - [ ] Create targeted problem sets to evaluate Titans memory benefits
   - [ ] Develop problems for evaluating Transformer² adaptation
   - [ ] Implement visual math problems for MVoT testing
   - [ ] Design problems for evaluating BLT byte-level processing

3. **Model Integration**
   - [ ] Connect data generator to main training pipeline
   - [ ] Extend tokenizer to integrate with all NEAT components
   - [ ] Implement efficient data caching for faster iteration
   - [ ] Create data augmentation strategies for robust training

4. **Evaluation Metrics**
   - [ ] Design metrics for measuring generalization performance
   - [ ] Implement metrics for memory utilization across problem types
   - [ ] Create visualization tools for comparing model variations
   - [ ] Design controlled difficulty progression for component evaluation

## Implementation Approach

1. **Progressive Complexity**
   - Start with simpler problem types and gradually extend to more complex ones
   - Ensure each component of the NEAT architecture can be evaluated individually
   - Create problem sets that target specific component benefits

2. **Component-Specific Testing**
   - For Titans Memory: Problems requiring long-term context retention
   - For Transformer² Adaptation: Problems with varied patterns requiring adaptation
   - For MVoT: Problems with visual/spatial elements that benefit from visualization
   - For BLT: Problems with varying entropy levels to test dynamic patching

3. **Controlled Distribution Shifts**
   - In-distribution testing: Problems similar to training set
   - Out-of-distribution: Problems with similar patterns but different value ranges
   - Cross-domain: Problems requiring transfer of concepts between domains

## Next Steps

The immediate next steps are:

1. Complete the advanced problem types to create more challenging test cases
2. Develop component-specific problem sets for targeted evaluation
3. Integrate the data generator with the main training pipeline
4. Implement comprehensive evaluation metrics

These steps will enable us to fully evaluate the benefits of the NEAT architecture compared to traditional models, particularly in terms of test-time learning, adaptation, and generalization capabilities.
