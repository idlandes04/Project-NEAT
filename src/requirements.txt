# Core dependencies
torch>=2.0.0 # PyTorch version 2.0+ recommended for scaled_dot_product_attention
PyYAML>=6.0 # For loading YAML configuration files

# Optional dependencies (used by specific features)
numpy>=1.20.0 # Often used with torch, explicitly used in SVD utils
scikit-learn>=1.0.0 # For randomized SVD in svd_utils (optional)
safetensors>=0.4.0 # For loading models/codebooks saved in .safetensors format (optional)

# Add other dependencies as needed (e.g., for specific tokenizers, datasets, logging)
# Example:
# transformers>=4.30.0 # If integrating Hugging Face models/tokenizers
# datasets>=2.10.0 # If using Hugging Face datasets library
# sentencepiece # If using SentencePiece tokenizer
# wandb # If using Weights & Biases for logging
